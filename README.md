# three.js-demo2

### Start:
After downloading the repo you will have to install the packages with:
```bash
npm install
```
After that you should be able to run the project with:
```bash
npm start
```

### Features:
When the program starts you will be able to choose a color and texture in the modal.  The selected options will be shown in the footer.  When you click on a wall or tile it will change to that color and texture.  If you hold the shift key while clicking on an object it will reset to it's default color and texture.

### Known Issues:
The modal can be opened/closed with the Enter key but if you hit the enter key repeatedly in rapid succession it will cause the page to freeze up.
